## Overview

The **USC Story Generator Platform** is a dual-purpose web application that addresses federal funding loss through community-driven endowments while providing students with a modern, long-form storytelling platform to replace the outdated USC website.

### What Makes This Unique

This is the **only platform that combines**:
- ✅ Modern storytelling with privacy controls
- ✅ Community-driven financial support for students
- ✅ Ethical corporate partnerships via freemium model
- ✅ AI-powered development for social good

### AI for Greater Good

This platform demonstrates how **AI and technology can serve a social mission**. The project itself was collaboratively developed with AI assistance (Claude as Product Owner Agent via BMad framework), showcasing how AI can accelerate solutions to real-world social challenges like student financial hardship and institutional inequity.

---

## The Problem

### 1. Federal Funding Crisis
- Federal funding cuts threaten student financial stability at USC
- No modern platform for community-driven tuition support
- Students lack tools to receive grassroots financial assistance from families, churches, and local community groups

### 2. Outdated Communication Infrastructure
- USC website is extremely outdated and cannot be edited by students
- Students resort to fragmented social media (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok) unsuitable for long-form storytelling
- No university-tailored platform with proper access controls and moderation

---

## The Solution

### Three-Pillar Approach

#### 1️⃣ Community-Driven Endowments

Three revenue streams targeting **$50K in first 6 months**:

| Stream | Contributors | Purpose | Target |
|--------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Family-Community** | Families, friends, churches, community groups | Direct tuition payments to specific students (Stripe ACH, <1% fees) | $20K |
| **Sponsors** | Foundations, alumni, local businesses | Philanthropic donations without advertising requirements | $15K |
| **Corporates** | Companies (Colgate, restaurants, tech) | Endowment contributions in exchange for ethical loyalty advertising | $15K (5+ partners) |

#### 2️⃣ Modern Storytelling Platform

- **JAMstack Architecture:** Eleventy (11ty) + Xano + Netlify for performance (<2s page loads, 99.5%+ uptime)
- **Rich Text Editor:** Webflow-designed components for professional content creation
- **Private Groups:** Classes, families, peer circles with granular privacy controls
- **Sophisticated Moderation:** Flagging, review queues, admin governance tools

#### 3️⃣ Freemium Business Model

**FREE Tier:**
- Public story publishing
- Basic dashboard
- Public commenting
- Browse groups and loyalty marketplace

**PREMIUM Tier** (Unlocked by corporate loyalty opt-in):
- Privacy controls (public, USC-only, groups, private)
- Create and manage private groups
- Enhanced dashboard with moderation tools
- Corporate loyalty discounts (20% off Colgate, local restaurants, etc.)

**Value Exchange:** Students who want privacy features opt-in to receive corporate advertising → unlock PREMIUM features + receive discount codes from sponsor companies.
