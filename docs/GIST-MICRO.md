## Slack/Discord Message

Hey team! 👋

Just finished the complete PRD for **USC Story Generator Platform** - a really exciting dual-purpose project:

**What it is:**
Modern storytelling platform (think Medium + Groups) + community-driven endowment system (families/sponsors/corporates support students)

**The hook:**
Students opt-in to corporate loyalty programs (get discounts) → unlock PREMIUM features (privacy controls, private groups). Corporations contribute endowments to student fund in exchange for tasteful advertising access.

**The numbers:**
• 6 months to MVP
• $50K endowment target
• 500+ students
• <$200/month to run

**The tech:**
Eleventy (static gen) + Xano (headless CMS) + Netlify + Auth0 + permit.io + Stripe

**Try the prototype:** https://usc-story.netlify.app/

Would love feedback! This is a great example of using modern tech to solve real social problems (federal funding crisis affecting students).

## Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

"USC Story Generator is a platform that addresses two critical problems at once:

**First**, the outdated USC website that students can't edit and doesn't support modern storytelling. We replace it with a JAMstack platform featuring long-form story publishing, private groups for classes and peer circles, and sophisticated privacy controls.

**Second**, federal funding cuts that threaten student financial stability. We've built a community-driven endowment system where families, churches, community groups, sponsors, and corporations can contribute directly to student tuition.

The business model is a freemium exchange: students who want privacy features opt-in to corporate loyalty programs - like getting 20% off at Colgate - which unlocks PREMIUM tier with privacy controls and private groups. Corporations contribute endowments to the student fund and get tasteful, clearly-disclosed advertising access to students who opted in.

**The target:** $50K in endowments within 6 months, 500+ students, all running on less than $200 a month in operational costs.

It's a perfect example of AI and technology serving a social mission - this entire PRD was developed with AI assistance in hours rather than weeks, demonstrating how we can accelerate solutions to real problems."
