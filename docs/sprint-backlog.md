## Research Notes

### Tiptap / ProseMirror Evaluation Criteria

**Tiptap Pro:**
- Built on ProseMirror (battle-tested)
- Collaboration extension (Y.js / Hocuspocus)
- AI extension for content generation
- React/Vue/vanilla JS support
- Commercial license required for Pro features

**ProseMirror (vanilla):**
- Full control, no licensing fees
- Steeper learning curve
- Manual collaboration setup required
- More flexibility for custom features

**Decision Factors:**
- [ ] Budget constraints (<$200/month total)
- [ ] Collaboration requirements (real-time editing?)
- [ ] AI integration needs
- [ ] Developer experience/time-to-market

### AI Strategy Positioning

**Core AI Principles:**
1. AI serves students, not advertisers
2. Transparent, explainable features
3. Privacy-first implementation
4. Accessibility enhancement

**Potential AI Features (Phased):**
- **MVP:** Basic content moderation (flagging)
- **Phase 2:** Story writing assistance, grammar/style suggestions
- **Phase 3:** Smart matching (students ↔ sponsors), sentiment analysis
